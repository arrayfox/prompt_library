At the end of every prompt, no matter how big or small. Whatever task, I just ask ChatGPT to further clarify. You should too. Sometimes I change the wording. For example I will say ***"keep asking questions until I feel that you have enough information"*** It's nothing fancy, but it has helped change businesses, daily life, and it helps ChatGPT learn. The questions it's asking. you can ask it to remember. That way for future projects, it knows what you want to say before you get the chance to say it.
